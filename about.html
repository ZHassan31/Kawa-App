                <p class="dr-iwama-description">Michael Iwama the author of the Kawa Model is a Canadian occupational therapist who was born
                    and raised in Japan, and
                    currently working in the US
                    at Duke University.</p>
                <p  class="dr-iwama-description">Over the course of his 35-year career, Iwama
                        has practised in the field of return-to-work
                        occupational therapy and has worked as an
                        academician at 7 universities in 4 countries.</p>
                        <p  class="dr-iwama-description">His experiences of acculturating to different
                            cultural spaces, and the insights that such
                            challenges and opportunities raise, drive his
                            interest in the culture and health theory
                            construction. The Kawa Model is one of the
                            products of his cross-cultural journey.

    <div class="text width">
        <p id="occupational-therapy-definition">Occupational therapy is a health profession
            that supports and enables people to resolve
            practical problems in their everyday life so
            that they can participate in the roles and
            activities that are important and valuable to
            them.</p>

        <p id="occupational-therapy-definition">Four simple components of a river are used to
            represent a person’s state of well-being in the
            context of the (physical, social, and ambient)
            environment. The 4 elements (water, rocks,
            driftwood, and riverbanks) work together to
            tell the story of the person’s everyday life
            experience.</p>

<!-- Water -->
<div class="align">
    <h1 class="header-text" >Water</h1>
    <div class="text width">
        <p id="occupational-therapy-definition">Water is the most important element
            of a river. In the Kawa Model, water
            symbolises life flow, energy, and for
            some occupational therapists.
            Rocks
            The characteristics (width, depth, and speed)
            of the river is determined by surrounding river
            elements (rocks, driftwood, and riverbanks).
            The spaces between these river elements
            form the key positive points where there is
            potential for greater flow.
            </p>

    <!-- Rocks -->
<div class="align">
    <h1 class="header-text" >Rocks</h1>
    <div class="text width">
        <p id="occupational-therapy-definition">Rocks of different size, shape,
            and number can significantly
            affect the state and flow of a
            river. In the Kawa Model, rocks represent life
            challenges, difficulties, and problems that act
            as barriers and blockages to life flow.
            </p>

    <!-- Driftwood -->
    <div class="align">
        <h1 class="header-text" >Driftwood</h1>
        <div class="text width">
            <p id="occupational-therapy-definition">Driftwood represents personal
                factors and attributes that can
                have a positive, neutral, and/or
                negative influence on the river’s flow.
                “Neutral” driftwood can be seen to float on
                top of the water without any consequences.
                However, the same driftwood can have a
                negative effect on the river by increasing
                blockage to the flow by settling against other
                structures (rocks, riverbanks, and other
                driftwood). Conversely, driftwood can have a
                positive effect on the river’s flow by colliding
                with or eroding the surfaces of rocks and
                riverbanks, which can create and restore
                greater channels of flow.

    <!-- Riverbank -->
    <div class="align">

            <p id="occupational-therapy-definition" >Model represent the
                environment. This includes the
                physical, social, and ambient
                environments that enable all
                rcomponents of the river to connect. When
                environmental conditions are problematic,
                the walls thicken and constrain the water flow.
                When environmental conditions are good, the
                walls become thinner and expand the river’s
                water capacity.
                The riverbanks are divided into 2 layers. The
                closer layer to the water contains the person’s
                physical and social environments. The farther
                layer contains factors and events that occur
                in the ambient environment.
